USAGE:
$python3 chat.py

Firstly, the program welcomes you.

Then,it takes your credentials and shows you.

! You have to be in the same network to communicate with other users.

You will see main menu that includes two commands.

1)You can enable Announcer to send announce packet. 
2)You can reach your messages.

I desire to be graded about this project.
